We were chatting a little. I was telling her how much I admire Pawel for his leaned back attitude and reasoning. When Pawel is confronted with an emotionally loaded topic he distances himself first and reflects on the matter, coming back having sorted out his thoughts, bringing real value to the table. This is something especially learned from him, granted I am still learning. Anyway, Anna and I made some stupid jokes again about deleting calendars. It was hilarious. I get all teary when I write this down. I feel like it is still ok to make the calendar joke because I appreciate Pawel so much and am deeply grateful to ever got the chance to know him as a person. Giant Swarm brought all of us together and made these for me so meaningful relationships possible.",

That one time when we all got together for our onsite, some people had to fly around half the globe only to see each other in person again. Thomas was grinding so hard that he pushed and merged pull requests from 10k altitude flying over the middle of the atlantic ocean. I thought this was some next level shit nobody could ever have imaged only 100 years ago. What a time to be alive.",

    "text": "In Chapter PE we had a session recently to discuss how to move forward on a particular issue. There was me, taking on one side of the argument, and there were others, taking another stance. I had a pretty strong opinion, and actually still have it. Eventually we did a fist to five voting to come to a conclusion once everyone got the chance to express their thoughts and arguments on the topic at hand. The vote was against my position and in that moment I wanted to scream and shout and cry in the corner because it hurt inside and I still think somehow we made the wrong decision. It was a super bitter pill to swallow for me in this moment, but nobody got mad. Nobody took it personal. The session ended and we were still all just friends like nothing happened. Sure I took my five minutes to breathe and get over myself. But that was it. The point is, I am grateful to have so many courageous people on my side. People who do not just back up. People who stand their ground and fight for what they think is right in an articulate and civilised manner. People who hold the line. People I can learn so much from. I do not know what is right or wrong in this case, really. But I know that we stand together. I know we can overcome any problem together. And I know that I never stop learning with you on my side.",

It is less about partying and onsites (even if they mean a lot to me <3) it is more about having a purpose in your daily work (no bullshit job) and the 'go' to self-organize. It is about no boundaries to think and getting the information you need to make decisions (transparency) and decide as an adult person what is best for you. It is about the flexibility to integrate all elements of life into your day.",

My favourite example is Jour Fix (monthly company update) which is pretty late in the day 4:30-6pm CET so most kids are no longer in childcare, but noone wants to miss out on being updated on what has been happening in the company in the last month. Hence, there are many team members with children in their video calls but noone bats an eyelid.",

We went remote step by step and made our learnings, we started with Europe, as nobody has solved the time zone yet, and are now ready for the world. We did not hire a certain nationality in a row (like: Now, we open an office in the US); we did not only hire extroverts only. We took a lot of thoughts into ensuring that as different as people are, a few basic beliefs are shared. Now this scales.",

    "text": "Why we do not count holidays or work time?
    This goes back to the original founding of Giant Swarm, where we said that we need very good people and these people all do not work for money. Of course they need to be paid but they are all at a level where, on average, they do not move jobs for money, but rather for an interesting environment, good work topics, great people, and so forth. Self Actualisation if you will.
They come to a company because they like the vision, the idea, and are intrinsically motivated to work there. As with most people, there are very few things I can do to closely monitor and control those people and it is already known that control is not a good motivator. Hence, my job as a “manager” needs to be to make you WANT to work.
As a next step, if I manage to do that, and make sure to make it clear that everyone takes the rest they need, then I should just let you do that. Take rest, when and where you want. Especially in our current setting you might take your laptop to holidays and do a few hangouts from there, or read a business book on the weekend, play poker with friends and get one as a customer. The line between personal and work life blurs more and more and I want to support that, because it should and it should in a way that does not create stress.

This has really helped me to understand how 'flexible work hours' and 'self-responsibility' were lived at GS. Furthermore, it is a sign for trust because false excuses or secret AFKs seem to be way less likely to occur.",
