We were chatting a little. I was telling her how much I admire Pawel for his leaned back attitude and reasoning. When Pawel is confronted with an emotionally loaded topic he distances himself first and reflects on the matter, coming back having sorted out his thoughts, bringing real value to the table. This is something especially learned from him, granted I am still learning. Anyway, Anna and I made some stupid jokes again about deleting calendars. It was hilarious. I get all teary when I write this down. I feel like it is still ok to make the calendar joke because I appreciate Pawel so much and am deeply grateful to ever got the chance to know him as a person. Giant Swarm brought all of us together and made these for me so meaningful relationships possible.",

    "text": "You know how it is in other companies. Most people do not even know that you exist. When new people join Giant Swarm and get Slack access before they even worked a single day for the company, there is just an avalanche of greetings, GIFs and rocket emojis and all that cute shit. Sometimes you need to scroll like real bad to see what actually happened in #random when new people join. It is hilarious and so heart warming. Half the company comes running just to welcome you. So and this is then just day zero.",

That one time when we all got together for our onsite, some people had to fly around half the globe only to see each other in person again. Thomas was grinding so hard that he pushed and merged pull requests from 10k altitude flying over the middle of the atlantic ocean. I thought this was some next level shit nobody could ever have imaged only 100 years ago. What a time to be alive.",
