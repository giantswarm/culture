We were chatting a little. I was telling her how much I admire Pawel for his leaned back attitude and reasoning. When Pawel is confronted with an emotionally loaded topic he distances himself first and reflects on the matter, coming back having sorted out his thoughts, bringing real value to the table. This is something especially learned from him, granted I am still learning. Anyway, Anna and I made some stupid jokes again about deleting calendars. It was hilarious. I get all teary when I write this down. I feel like it is still ok to make the calendar joke because I appreciate Pawel so much and am deeply grateful to ever got the chance to know him as a person. Giant Swarm brought all of us together and made these for me so meaningful relationships possible.",

When new people join Giant Swarm and get Slack access before they even worked a single day for the company, there is just an avalanche of greetings, GIFs and rocket emojis and all that cute shit. Sometimes you need to scroll like real bad to see what actually happened in #random when new people join. It is hilarious and so heart warming. Half the company comes running just to welcome you. So and this is then just day zero.",

That one time when we all got together for our onsite, some people had to fly around half the globe only to see each other in person again. Thomas was grinding so hard that he pushed and merged pull requests from 10k altitude flying over the middle of the atlantic ocean. I thought this was some next level shit nobody could ever have imaged only 100 years ago. What a time to be alive.",

    "text": "In Chapter PE we had a session recently to discuss how to move forward on a particular issue. There was me, taking on one side of the argument, and there were others, taking another stance. I had a pretty strong opinion, and actually still have it. Eventually we did a fist to five voting to come to a conclusion once everyone got the chance to express their thoughts and arguments on the topic at hand. The vote was against my position and in that moment I wanted to scream and shout and cry in the corner because it hurt inside and I still think somehow we made the wrong decision. It was a super bitter pill to swallow for me in this moment, but nobody got mad. Nobody took it personal. The session ended and we were still all just friends like nothing happened. Sure I took my five minutes to breathe and get over myself. But that was it. The point is, I am grateful to have so many courageous people on my side. People who do not just back up. People who stand their ground and fight for what they think is right in an articulate and civilised manner. People who hold the line. People I can learn so much from. I do not know what is right or wrong in this case, really. But I know that we stand together. I know we can overcome any problem together. And I know that I never stop learning with you on my side.",
